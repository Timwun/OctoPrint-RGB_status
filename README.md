# OctoPrint-Rgb_status

Adds RGB LED support to OctoPrint with the ability to choose effects based on the current status of your printer

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/Timwun/OctoPrint-Rgb_status/archive/master.zip
    
### Running Without Root

Since OctoPrint should usually not be run as root, the default LED pin is 10 (SPI). For details about what may be required to use SPI on your instance, see https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x#spi

SPI requires you to be in the gpio group if you wish to control your LEDs without root.
You can add the pi user to the group with `sudo adduser pi gpio`

You'll also need to enable SPI by running sudo raspi-config interfacing options > SPI > Enable
